# This workflow will install dependencies and create a build suitable
# to be used in an AWS Lambda Layer.  The build will then be uploaded
# to S3 and then can be accessed from any lambda that uses the layer.
#
# This build is only for dev builds.  Releases will be built from a
# seperate action.
#
# A new version of the layer will be created for every branch when a
# pull request is intitiated.  This allows us to test the layer in a
# dev environment on AWS BEFORE the code is merged into master.
